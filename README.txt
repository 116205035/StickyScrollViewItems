StickyScrollViewItems is made to be very simple to use, just replace you're current ScrollView with StickyScrollView and start tagging the views you want sticking to the top.

**USAGE**

Tag any view inside the StickyScrollView (as with a regular ScrollView only one child is allowed, i recommend using a LinearLayout, it is inside this layout that the sticky views should be marked) with "sticky" to make it stick the the top of the scroll container until a new sticky tagged view comes along and pushes it away. There are additional flags to add to the tag "-nonconstant" and "-hastransparancy". Add the "-nonconstant" flag to views with non constant drawing (Buttons with states, any view with animation etc). Add the "-hastransparancy" flag to any view that is not fully opaque. Views can has multiple flags set and the order has no effect. 

So the different tags are "sticky-nonconstant", "sticky-hastransparancy" and "sticky-nonconstant-hastransparancy"
Tags can be set either through xml with android:tag or through java code with View.setTag()
