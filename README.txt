StickyScrollViewItems is made to be very simple to use, just replace you're current ScrollView with StickyScrollView and start tagging the views you want sticking to the top.

**USAGE**

Tag any view inside the StickyScrollView (as with a regular ScrollView only one child is aloud, i recommend using a LinearLayout, it is inside this layout that the sticky views should be marked) with either "sticky" or "sticky-nonconstant" to make it stick the the top of the scroll container until a new sticky tagged view comes along and pushes it away. Tag views that have a constant drawing (TextViews, ImageViews etc) with "sticky" and views where the drawing is not constant (Buttons with states, any view with animation etc) with "sticky-nonconstant".
